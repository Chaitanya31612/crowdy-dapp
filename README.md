## Technology Used

Used truffle toolkit with react

**Frontend**
- HTML/CSS/JS
- React.js
- SCSS
- reactstrap

**Truffle Backend**
- Solidity for Smart Contract
- Ganache local network

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was to build a decentralized application solving current problems. There is a very critical problem in the working of current crowdfunding systems, centralization being the major one followed by accountability and consensus system for deciding expenses. I got inspiration about this application from a video of Stephen Grider where he talked about having this idea and then I implemented it and tested it on the local ganache network. This solves a lot of these problems by using the advantages blockchain provide as a technology, which include transparency, security, decentralization, consensus. The process is made as simple as possible.

## How was it built
First the smart contract for the application was created on **Remix IDE** which was tested with different inputs, then I used `truffle unbox react` to get a basic truffle template with react included. The latest version of solidity and react with Context API has been used.
I then added the contract in the code, then wrote tests for the application which I tested using `truffle test`. After testing and finalizing I deployed them on ganache local network using `truffle migrate --network ganache_local` with instance of ganache running.
Then I started working on the frontend part of the application. I started with designing in **AdobeXD**. I developed the frontend using react and npm libraries.

## Future Scope
- Search for campaigns
- Profiles for managers and contributers
- More Semantic UI
- Spam filtering and discussion channels
